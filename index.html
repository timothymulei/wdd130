        <p>I belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints! I believe that i am a child of God. I am here on earth to gain experience, learn to love others, and most importantly, to come unto my saviour Jesus Christ, by accepting His grace and restored gospel in my life. I show my faith through repentance, baptism by emmersion, recieving the gift of Holly Ghost, and enduaring to the end.</p> <p> I believe that Jesus Christ has called prophets in this last days. I also believe that through the ordinances performed in the Holly temples, famillies can be sealed together forever, so that my family will be a family in heaven.</p>
