        <p>I belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints! I believe that i am a child of God. I am here on earth to gain experience, learn to love others, and most importantly, to come unto my saviour Jesus Christ, by accepting His grace and restored gospel in my life. I show my faith through repentance, baptism by emmersion, recieving the gift of Holly Ghost, and enduaring to the end. I believe that Jesus Christ has called prophets in this last days. I also believe that through the ordinances performed in the Holly temples, famillies can be sealed together forever, so that my family will be a family in heaven.</p>

        <p>Amboseli National Park (formerly Maasai Amboseli Game Reserve), is a National Park in Kajiado County, Kenya. The name "Amboseli comes from a Maasai word Empusel meaning "salty dust place", and it is one of the best places in Africa to view large herds of elephants. To the south of the Amboseli basin the land rises sharply towards Mount Kilimanjaro and the Kenya-Tanzanian border, while wetlands dot the landscape on an east-west transverse, giving an outstanding scenic beauty. The ecosystem’s backdrop to the south is the snow-capped Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s highest peak at 19,600 feet, adorning three scenic peaks: Shira, Kibo and Mawenzi. It also offers a scenic view to the east where the young volcanic Chyulu range and lava forests stretches into Tsavo West National Park, while up north is a series of hills, including the Losoito, Lemipoti, Ilng’arunyoni and Lemomo hills that extend into the Kenyan highlands. The wetlands including Lake Amboseli are the landscape's most defining feature. They are charged by groundwater seeps and springs fed through an underground drainage system with water originating on the forested catchments and volcanic soils of Mount Kilimanjaro and the Chyulu Hills.</p>
